<h1><p align="center">0x16. C - Simple Shell</h1></p></font>

# Simple Shell
A simple UNIX command interpreter: It's a simple command line prompt that takes the most basics of commands that are present in the bach shell and runs them. 
This shell was built as a project for ALX School.

`the shell` works like the bash and other basic shells.

The shell works by being compiled using GCC 4.8.5 compiler or later versions. The shell can compile using `gcc 4.8.4 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o shell`.

## Example of how to launch the shell after compiling:
`./shell`

* Output: prompt to terminal: `$ `

### Compilation
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`
